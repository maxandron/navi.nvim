A small Neovim companion for JSON-defined source tours. Navi opens each stop, marks its source range, and renders its Markdown-like note as virtual lines above the range.

Navi has no required dependencies. If [Telescope](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) is available, `:NaviPick` uses it; otherwise it uses `vim.ui.select`.

## Agent-driven walkthroughs

Navi is the presentation layer in a larger agent-driven walkthrough stack:

- [Terminal Control](https://github.com/anomalyco/terminal-control) gives an agent such as OpenCode a shared, visible Neovim PTY that the user can watch and control.
- The installable [Terminal Control skill](https://github.com/anomalyco/terminal-control/tree/main/skills/terminal-control) teaches the agent how to inspect the visible screen, send input, wait for rendered state, and capture evidence.
- The installable [Code Walkthrough skill](https://github.com/kitlangton/skills/tree/main/skills/code-walkthrough) is the workflow: verify the code and output, author one immutable Navi tour, then present it through the shared terminal session.

Install the agent skills:

```sh
npx skills add anomalyco/terminal-control --skill terminal-control
npx skills add kitlangton/skills --skill code-walkthrough
```

The walkthrough skill expects `termctrl`, Neovim 0.10 or newer, and Navi. Once they are available, an agent can launch the shared editor from the canonical project directory:

```sh
termctrl run walkthrough --cwd /path/to/project -- nvim
```

The agent loads a verified tour with `:NaviLoad /absolute/path/to/tour.json`; the user follows it in the same Neovim session. See the Code Walkthrough skill for the complete authoring, verification, presentation, and cleanup procedure.

## Features

- Resolves symlinks and compares real paths when matching stops to buffers.
- Locates ranges by line numbers or literal start and end patterns.
- Renders Markdown-like headings, emphasis, links, lists, quotes, rules, and fenced code in virtual lines.
- Wraps notes to the window's text viewport, excluding number and sign columns.
- Renders each note above its range and scrolls every jump until the whole note is visible, so a long range never hides its explanation.
- Uses an asterisk sign and no winbar for a one-stop tour.
- Uses numbered signs and a count-only `current/total` winbar for multi-stop tours.
- Provides Telescope and built-in pickers plus an explicit clear command.
- Optionally runs the nearest Neotest test and renders its status, failures, and console output beneath the test.
- Clears inline test evidence as soon as its source buffer changes.
- Leaves mappings entirely under user control.

## Requirements

- Neovim 0.10 or newer

## Installation

### lazy.nvim

```lua
{
  "kitlangton/navi.nvim",
}
```

No `setup()` call is required.

For a local checkout before publication:

```lua
{
  dir = vim.fn.expand("~/code/open-source/navi.nvim"),
}
```

### vim.pack

On Neovim versions with `vim.pack`, add Navi directly from its Git repository:

```lua
vim.pack.add({
  "https://github.com/kitlangton/navi.nvim",
})
```

### Manual

Clone the repository into a directory on Neovim's `packpath`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kitlangton/navi.nvim \
  ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/plugins/start/navi.nvim
```

Alternatively, add an existing checkout to `runtimepath` in `init.lua`:

```lua
vim.opt.runtimepath:prepend(vim.fn.expand("~/path/to/navi.nvim"))
```

## Commands

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `:NaviLoad {file}` | Load a tour from a JSON file without modifying the file. |
| `:NaviNext` | Go to the next stop. |
| `:NaviPrev` | Go to the previous stop. |
| `:NaviPick` | Select any stop with Telescope or `vim.ui.select`. |
| `:NaviClear` | End the tour, remove its signs and virtual lines, and restore the prior winbar. |
| `:NaviTest` | Run the nearest test and render concise evidence inline. Available after configuring the optional Neotest consumer. |

Navi does not create global mappings. Optional mappings can call either the commands or Lua API:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<Tab>", "<Cmd>NaviNext<CR>", { desc = "Next Navi stop" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<S-Tab>", "<Cmd>NaviPrev<CR>", { desc = "Previous Navi stop" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>np", "<Cmd>NaviPick<CR>", { desc = "Pick Navi stop" })
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>nc", "<Cmd>NaviClear<CR>", { desc = "Clear Navi tour" })
```

## Inline test evidence

Navi can use [Neotest](https://github.com/nvim-neotest/neotest) and an installed adapter to turn tests into executable examples. This integration is optional; source tours retain no required dependencies.

Register Navi as a Neotest consumer:

```lua
require("neotest").setup({
  adapters = {
    require("neotest-vitest")({}),
  },
  consumers = {
    navi = require("navi.evidence"),
  },
})
```

Run the nearest test with `:NaviTest` or map the consumer directly:

```lua
vim.keymap.set("n", "<leader>Te", function()
  require("neotest").navi.run()
end, { desc = "Test inline evidence" })
```

Navi renders the structured pass or failure status beneath the test. For Vitest, captured `console.log` and `console.error` blocks appear as concise detail lines, making the test itself usable as executable tutorial documentation. Any edit to the buffer clears prior evidence. Navi refuses to run an unsaved buffer and discards a result if its source changes while the test is running, so visible evidence always describes the current source.

## JSON schema

A tour is a JSON array of stop objects:

```json
[
  {
    "file": "src/example.ts",
    "pattern": "export function example",
    "end_pattern": "return result",
    "message": "## The example\n\nThis range returns the computed **result**."
  },
  {
    "file": "src/other.ts",
    "line": 12,
    "end_line": 18,
    "message": "A stop can use explicit line numbers."
  }
]
```

| Field | Type | Required | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `file` | string | yes | File to open. Relative paths are resolved from Neovim's working directory. |
| `line` | positive integer | exactly one start anchor | One-based start line. |
| `pattern` | non-empty string | exactly one start anchor | Literal text used to find the first matching start line. |
| `end_line` | positive integer | no | One-based inclusive end line. Mutually exclusive with `end_pattern`. |
| `end_pattern` | non-empty string | no | Literal text used to find the first match at or after the start. Mutually exclusive with `end_line`. |
| `message` | string | yes | Markdown-like note rendered above the source range. May be empty. |

The tour must be a non-empty array of stop objects. Every source file must be readable when the tour is loaded. Numeric anchors must be within the file, an end must not precede its start, and every pattern must resolve. Pattern matching is literal, not a Lua pattern or regular expression.

Validation is transactional: Navi resolves and validates every stop before replacing the active tour. Malformed JSON, a missing source or tour file, an unresolved pattern, or any schema error reports the stop and field involved while leaving the prior tour and its UI intact.

## Lua API

```lua
local navi = require("navi")

-- Load decoded Lua stop tables.
navi.load({
  {
    file = "src/example.ts",
    line = 10,
    end_line = 14,
    message = "Explain this range.",
  },
})

-- Or load a JSON string.
navi.load(vim.json.encode({
  {
    file = "src/example.ts",
    line = 10,
    end_line = 14,
    message = "Explain this range.",
  },
}))

-- Load a JSON file without modifying it.
navi.load_file("/path/to/tour.json")

navi.next()
navi.prev()
navi.goto_stop(1)
navi.pick()
navi.clear()
```

The current state is available as `navi.stops` and `navi.current`.

## Testing

Run the dependency-free headless suite from any working directory:

```sh
make test
# or
./scripts/test
```

Format or check the Lua sources with StyLua:

```sh
make format
make format-check
```
